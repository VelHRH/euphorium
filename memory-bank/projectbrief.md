# Project Brief: New Blood

## Project Overview
A modern web application foundation with a robust technical stack, featuring:
- Full-stack TypeScript implementation
- GraphQL API with NestJS backend
- Next.js frontend with Material-UI
- Shared type system between frontend and backend
- Comprehensive authentication system
- Containerized development environment

## Core Objectives
- ✅ Create a scalable, modern web application foundation
- ✅ Implement secure authentication (JWT + Google OAuth)
- ✅ Set up shared type system between frontend and backend
- ✅ Establish containerized development environment
- ✅ Configure CI/CD pipeline basics
- [Future objectives to be defined based on specific project requirements]

## Project Scope
Current scope includes:
- Technical infrastructure setup
- Authentication system
- Basic API structure
- Development environment configuration
- Code quality tools and standards

Future scope to be determined based on specific project requirements.

## Success Criteria
Infrastructure Success Metrics:
- ✅ Functional GraphQL API
- ✅ Working authentication system
- ✅ Shared type system
- ✅ Docker development environment
- ✅ Database integration

[Additional success criteria to be defined with specific project goals]

## Key Stakeholders
- Development Team
[Additional stakeholders to be added based on project direction]

## Timeline
Current Phase: Foundation Setup (Completed)
Next Phase: [To be determined based on project direction]

## Constraints
Technical Constraints:
- Node.js environment
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker containerization
- TypeScript type safety
- ESLint/Prettier code standards

[Additional constraints to be added based on project requirements]

## Risk Factors
Current Technical Risks:
- Maintaining type synchronization between frontend and backend
- Managing authentication security
- Docker configuration maintenance
- Database schema evolution

[Additional risks to be identified as project evolves]
